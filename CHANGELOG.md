## 2020-04-12

**Fixed bugs:**

- Fix issue [\#37](https://github.com/elad-bar/ha-blueiris/issues/37) - Restart of HASS causes all entities to be renamed to defaults <br/>
  improving the way the component is loading, unloading and discover new entities (sensors, camera and switch). <br/>
  the main issue as reported in the past was that once changing the entity_id / name it will return to the original after restart. <br/>
  another issue that caused by the way it was handled, upon changing the options (settings) - it took few seconds to present the new entities and sometimes it happened only after restart. <br/>
  In that version, the entity_id, name will remain as manually set and changes of options will take place immediately
